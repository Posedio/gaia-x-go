# Gaia-X Go

## Package for Gaia-X Compliance in Golang

This project aims to showcase interactions with the Gaia-X Digital Clearing Houses (Versions Tagus and Loire) which are the center part to reach Gaia-X Compliance.
It is not meant for production usage, and it is a private project for educational use, although it enables some of the needed verification mechanism. 

For the official Gaia-X Repositories pleas visit https://gitlab.com/gaia-x/ or see https://docs.gaia-x.eu/
